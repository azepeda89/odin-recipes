<li>Put a pot of water on to boil. Fill the pot with just enough water to submerge the pasta. Use a little less water than you normally would so the water will be extra starchy as the pasta cooks. This will help in making a creamy sauce. When the water comes to a boil, add salt. Adding salt to pasta water helps to flavor the pasta. But remember that pecorino cheese is also very salty, so go easy when you salt the water. Boil the pasta, whether spaghetti or another shape, according to the package instructions, until al dente. It should be cooked through but firm to the bite.</li>

<li>Grate the pecorino cheese. While the pasta boils, use a microplane or the small ‘star’ holes of a box grater to finely grate 4 ounces Pecorino Romano cheese. You'll need about 3 very loosely filled cups. I use a microplane, as it produces a light, fluffy grated cheese that melts easily in the hot pasta water.</li>

<li>Toast and grind the pepper. Place 1 tablespoon whole peppercorns in a small non-stick skillet and set it on medium-high heat. Toast the peppercorns, shaking the pan often, for 2 to 3 minutes, just until they release their fragrance. Let the peppercorns cool slightly, then pour them into a spice grinder or a mortar. Grind or pound the peppercorns until coarsely ground. The coarsely ground pepper adds both flavor and texture to cacio e pepe.</li>

<li>Drain the pasta. Set a colander in the sink, with a heat-proof 2-cup measuring cup nearby. When the pasta is al dente, drain it in the colander set over a bowl. Reserve about 1 ½ cups of the boiling water in the measuring cup. Return the pasta to the pot and pour in about ⅓ cup of the water. Return the pasta to the stove but don’t turn on the heat.</li>

<li>Dress and serve the pasta. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of pepper and a handful of pecorino into the pot followed by another splash of hot pasta water and immediately begin stirring as vigorously as you can to mix the cheese with the noodles and water. Add another splash of water and another handful of cheese and stir, stir, stir to create a creamy sauce. Elbow grease is the key here to prevent the cheese from clumping. Add one more, small handful of cheese—reserve a little for garnish—and a final splash of hot water. Stir until everything is nicely combined and the noodles are well coated. Transfer the pasta to bowls, garnish each serving with a sprinkle of pepper and pecorino cheese and serve immediately, while still hot.</li>
